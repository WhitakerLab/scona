Introduction

What is scona
-------------

scona is a toolkit to analyse structural covariance brain networks using python.

scona takes regional cortical thickness data from structural MRI and generates a matrix of correlations between brain regions over a cohort of subjects. This correlation matrix is used to generate a variety of networks and network measures.
