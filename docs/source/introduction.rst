Introduction
============

What is scona
-------------

scona is a toolkit to analyse structural covariance brain networks using python.

scona takes regional cortical thickness data from structural MRI and generates a matrix of correlations between brain regions over a cohort of subjects. This correlation matrix is used to generate a variety of networks and network measures.

Installing scona
----------------

You can install scona directly from the GitHub repository::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona.git#egg=scona

If you want to edit scona it's recommended that you pass the ``-e`` flag to ``pip`` to install the package editably.

Getting Started
---------------

We have automatically generated `docstring <https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#writing-docstrings>`_ documentation and here's how to navigate to it.

See all docs organized in the alphabetical order:
    * :ref:`genindex`

See the structure of the package:
    * :ref:`modindex`

See the submodules page:
    * :ref:`ref-subpackages-label`

| Besides, you can type any function into the **search bar** and come up with some results.
| Alongside this documentation scona has some jupyter notebook `tutorials <https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona/tree/master/tutorials>`_.
