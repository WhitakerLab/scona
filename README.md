Welcome to the BrainNetworksInPython GitHub repository!:sparkles: <a href="https://youtu.be/ztm2knaLBFc"><img align="right" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwwL4kj5z1Id6uI/giphy.gif">

## What are we doing?
BrainNetworksInPython is a toolkit to analyse structural covariance brain networks using python.  

BrainNetworksInPython takes regional cortical thickness data obtained from structural MRI and generates a matrix of correlations between regions over a cohort of subjects. The correlation matrix is used alongside the [networkx package](https://networkx.github.io/) to generate a variety of networks and network measures.

The BrainNetworksInPython codebase was first developed by Dr Kirstie Whitaker for the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network publication "Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome" published in PNAS in 2016 [(Whitaker*, Vertes* et al, 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113)). This project is to take the existing codebase (accessible at https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016) and turn it into a documented, tested python package that is easy to use and re-use.

Check out our [tutorial](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/blob/master/Example_JupyterNotebook.ipynb) to get started.
